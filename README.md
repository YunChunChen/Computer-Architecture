# Computer-Architecture
## This repository contains some code implementations and materials of the computer architecture course.

The programming language will mainly focus on `verilog`. However, `assembly code` and `C++` are also included in the homework assignment.

### **\<HW1\>**

**[Description]** 
    
    Homework 1 aims at getting familiar with verilog and implement some simple functions.

**[Language]**    
    
    Verilog.

**[Function]**    

    1. We design an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with two kinds of implementation, behavior level and RTL level.  
       Test bench is provided. 
               
    2. We design a register file that realizes the write and read function with write enable control. Test bench 
       is provided.
               
    3. We design a simple calculator based on the previously designed arithmetic logic unit and register file. 
       However, to act more like a real calculator, we incorporate a multiplexer into our design, which enables 
       us to write data into the calculator. Test bench is provided.



### **\<HW2\>**

**[Description]** 

    Homework 2 aims at a deeper insight of how assembly code operates.

**[Language]**    

    Assembly code.

**[Function]**    


    We implement bubble sort and quick sort functions that can take in any number of inputs with 
    assembly code. However, the constraint is that the compiling environment we select is MIPS compiler. 


Any suggestions or bugs found are welcomed.
