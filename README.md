# Computer Architecture
## This repository contains some code implementations and materials of the computer architecture course.

The programming language will mainly focus on `verilog`. However, `assembly code` and `C++` are also included in the homework assignment.

### **\<HW1\>**

**[Description]** 
    
    
```    
Homework 1 aims at getting familiar with verilog and implementing some simple functions. 
```

**[Language]**    
    
```
Verilog.
```

**[Function]**    

```
1. Design an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with two kinds of implementation, behavior level and 
   RTL level. Test bench is provided. 
               
2. Design a register file that realizes the write and read function with write enable control.
   Test bench. is provided.
               
3. Design a simple calculator based on the previously designed arithmetic logic unit and 
   register file. However, to act more like a real calculator, we incorporate a multiplexer
   into our design, which enables us to write data into the calculator. Test bench is provided.
```







### **\<HW2\>**

**[Description]** 

```
Homework 2 aims at a deeper insight of the operation of the assembly code.
```

**[Language]**    

```
Assembly code.
```

**[Function]**    

```
I implement the bubble sort algorithm and quick sort algorithm that can take in any number of inputs with 
assembly code. However, the constraint is that the compiling environment is under QtSpim compiler. 
```







### **\<HW3\>**

**[Description]** 

```
Homework 3 aims at the implementation of the single cycle MIPS.
```

**[Language]**    

```
Verilog.
```

**[Function]**    

```
I implement the single cycle MIPS with verilog. For more details, please refer to the hw3 folder.
```
